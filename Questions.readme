1. Write a shell script that accepts valid file names as command line arguments and for each of the arguments, prints the type of the file.
  (Regular file, Directory file, Character device file, Block device file, Symbolic link file)
2. a) Write a shell script simply counts the number of lines in an input file.
   b) Write a shell script to extract a substring from a given string
3. Write a shell script to recursively traverse a folder to retrieve all files having permissions as accepted from the user.
4. Write a C program to display the name of user defined function after returning from the user defined function to main function using ‘setjmp’ and ‘longjmp’ functions.
5. Write a C program to do the following: using fork () create a child process. The child process prints its own process-id and id of its parent, The child process should                  read commands from the standard input and execute them (a minimal implementation of a shell – like program).and then exits. The parent process waits for its child to finish (by executing the wait ()) and prints its own process-id and the id of its child process and then exists.
6. Write a C program to generate the signals SIGINT, SIGFPE, SIGSEGV, SIGCHLD & SIGILL and provide signal handlers for the signals generated.
7. Write a C program to create a daemon which prompts for authentication (username and password) whenever user tries to display the contents of a file owned by the    user.
8. a) Write a C program to demonstrate two way Inter Process Communications between two processes using pipes. Use SELECT system call to monitor the read-ends             of the pipes.
   b) Write a C program to demonstrate two way Inter Process Communications between two processes using FIFO.
9. Implement message transfer using Message Queue form of IPC. The client process request for a message that is sent by the Server process. Server returns a                              suitable message if the message is not available.
10. Write a program to demonstrate Use semaphores to avoid race conditions. (Hint: Create an integer variable in Shared Memory that is incremented by multiple
    processes causing race condition).
